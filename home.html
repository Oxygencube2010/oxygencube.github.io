<h3> Daily Quote </h3>
<p> Don't dive into your passion. Let it grow day by day. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do grteat work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.</p>
